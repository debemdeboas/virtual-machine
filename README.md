## Motivation

University project.

## Solution

Most of the initial code was heavily inspired by the teacher's example, written in Java.
The command structure is the same, albeit with different parameters and language-specific improvements
(see [Command_SWAP](https://github.com/debemdeboas/virtual-machine/blob/b85251c46e8973682181b6869c9c7373f6b3a1ce/source/command/command.py#L481)).
