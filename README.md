## Motivation

University project.

## Solution

Most of the initial code was heavily inspired by the teacher's example, written in Java.
The command structure is the same, albeit with different parameters and language-specific improvements
(see [Command_SWAP](https://github.com/debemdeboas/virtual-machine/blob/dd735828e7c6e094c83b4d22d44e92d083c323b9/source/command/command.py#L572)).
